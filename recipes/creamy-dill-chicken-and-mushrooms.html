            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add onion; cook until translucent and soft, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken broth, wine, and sherry and bring to a boil. Stir in Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup dill, and Dijon mustard until well incorporated. Add butter and stir until melted.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a small bowl. Add a ladle of hot broth and whisk until smooth and no lumps remain. Pour mixture into the skillet and stir until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer until the sauce starts to thicken, 3 to 4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning and/or add additional dill if necessary.</li>
